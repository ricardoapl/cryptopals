## Overview

These are my solutions to [the cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/), a collection of cryptography challenges aimed at demonstrating attacks on real-world crypto.

To quote the official website:

> This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book.
> We give you problems to solve.
> They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions.
> We give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself.
> When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked. 

## Installation

If you wish to run some of these solutions on your local machine, just clone this repository and issue the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

To make sure that (most of) it is working, consider running ```python -m unittest discover -v``` while at the root directory.

## Requirements

In case you haven't noticed by now, you will need to install a Python 3 interpreter.

All requirements for these solutions should be fulfilled by issuing the command ```pip install -r requirements``` as previously stated.

## Support

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ricardoapl/cryptopals/issues) to report any bugs or discuss a solution.
